      <p class="p3">Time marches on, as time is wont to do, and it's somehow already September, can you believe it?
        I'm definitely still in denial about this but I know plenty are happy that Pumpkin Spice Latte season is upon us. As we get closer to launch, things are getting busier as we are making sure everything is shipshape.
        To that end, I wanted to give you a heads up about a blog change we're making: the Halo Community Spotlight blog is going to be on hiatus for the foreseeable future.
        This was not a  decision made lightly and we know it will cause some disappointment but the blog isn't gone forever and we are aiming to bring it back early next year.

        In the meantime, we have a decent chunk of ground to cover from MCC to Infinite and a smattering of things in between so I will stop dillydallying and we can get right to it!</p>
